```Exercice 1```

Starting from the concept of mobile first, create the design of your application. 
This project must have, as a minimum:

- Bootstrap from CDN and from downloaded files.
- The header must have a navbar + logo and links to login / register.
- When the page is in mobile version use the burger button
- When you click on login and register, you will need to open a modal window to access it. Obviously they have to have different data.


## Build with üõ†Ô∏è
